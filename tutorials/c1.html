            <h1>Forgotten C - Introduction</h1>
            <div class="text">
                C is a language that's often misunderstood for it's quirks and unfriendliness, but this happens because people tend to see it through the wrong mindset.
                <br>
                <h2>What is a programming language?</h2>
                A programming language is a formal language used to program a certain machine: Java controls the JVM, Python and Javascript control it's respectives environments, while C controls the processor and operating system.<br>
                You start to understand the choices and behaviors of the C language, when you look at it from the bottom of the abstraction tower (machine code and assembly), while most languages are teached to be seen from the top (natural language).
                <h2>The Base of the Tower</h2>
                For those who don't know assembly, a processor can only execute very simple instructions. Each processor has a different set, and each operating system has a different way to be called:
                <pre>
                    Exits program in DOS x86
                    <code>
                        mov ah, 4ch
                        mov al, 0
                        int 21h
                    </code>
                    Exits program in Linux x86
                    <code>
                        mov eax, 1
                        xor ebx, ebx
                        int 0x80
                    </code>
                    Exits program in Linux ARM
                    <code>
                        mov r7, #1
                        mov r0, #0
                        svc #0
                    </code>
                </pre>
                The most logical solution for this problem, would be making a language that provides the basic translation for more complex programs (or even languages) to be built on top.
                <h2>Universal Language</h2>
                C was invented to program a specific computer, called PDP-11, with a specific system, called UNIX. Due to how easy it was to port to another systems (just a few features on top of assembly),
                it quickly gained widespread usage, even before having a definied standard.<br><br>
                C became widely used in operating systems, libraries and programs, only replaced later by C++, which is a language inspired by C with more features and a different mindset.<br><br>
                However, the C programming language is still ubiquitous, and the base for important software like the Linux kernel, nginx, OpenSSL, CPython. The C API is basically omnipresent in multiple languages. 
                <h2>The Confusion of Tongues</h2>
                There's a push against the C language by ideological groups, but that's not the point of this introduction or the tutorials: only a fool would engage in modern tribalism about one language being better than other.<br><br>
                The point of this tutorial is to teach the language in the manner it is intended to be used, along with the reasons behind misunderstood features. C is a hammer that's misused on screws because people forgot what nails are.<br><br>
